    # WAAS Events and Container Models Dashboard

This app provides an **interactive dashboard** for viewing and analyzing **WAAS (Web Application and API Security) events** and **Container Models** from **Prisma Cloud**. Users can explore detailed security events, identify **attack types**, and review associated container images directly from the Prisma Cloud data.

### How to Use
Navigate through the data using the **sidebar filters**:
- Use the **"Attack Type"** filter to select specific attack types or view all by choosing the **"Select All"** option.
- The **"Image"** filter allows you to view events linked to particular container images.

This streamlined interface helps **security teams** quickly focus on relevant events and models for **efficient monitoring and response**.
